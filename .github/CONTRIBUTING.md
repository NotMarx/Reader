# Contributing to NReader

Thank you for your time in contributing **NReader**! To get started, please keep in mind that we have contribution rules that keep this project sustainable. If you are unsure what you are doing, please join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/b7AW2Zkcsw) and ask for some help!

## Getting started

Contributing is all about code. It is recommended that you have a decent knowledge of coding, especially in TypeScript. **NReader** uses several tools to keep itself running. If you think you are ready, please read the information below:

### TypeScript

As mentioned above, we want to make sure that you have an understandable skill in using TypeScript. Knowing only JavaScript is fine, but we still recommend that you also understand the basic TypeScript.


### Code Base

It must be very difficult to understand the entire code base of **NReader**. However, you do not need to understand everything! All logic implementations are done via NReader's custom built-in framework. The framework directory is also well-organised so it should ease you in reading what every file does.

Again, if you are still confused, our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/b7AW2Zkcsw) is available for developers!

### Oceanic Discord Library

**NReader** is powered by the [Oceanic](https://github.com/OceanicJS/Oceanic) Discord library. You need to have decent knowledge about this library if you want to make changes related to Discord mostly.

## Top Issues (Best to Get Started)

Any issues that are marked with the label "**good first issue**" is the best place to start contributing. Besides these, we also have an issue(s) that we decide to keep in our mind.

- Code Typing Definition
   - If you are a highly expert in TypeScript, you should be able to spot issues that we are unable to. Yes, the maintainer and developer of this project (aka [reinhello](https://github.com/reinhello)) is not a highly-expert TypeScript Wizard that works on the code typing definition. You are very welcome to make better changes on the typing definition.
